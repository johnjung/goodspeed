                            <summary>Principal colophon: Glory be to the Eternal Father and Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now and always 
                                forever and ever. Amen. He gave strength to the humble deacon, who is called Yovannēs to complete the word of God, 
                                the Gospel. I began with the grace of God and finished it with his mercies in the Armenian year of 1119. During the 
                                patriarchate of his holiness Bedros the Catholicos, and in the time of Bishop Yovannēs of Alovans Shamkarou, which 
                                belongs to St. Asdouadzadzin, a celibate penitent named Khouban desired and commissioned a Holy Gospel. It was to 
                                memorialize his own soul, the souls of his parents Sarkis and Tilikhan, those of his brothers Sahag and Abraham, his 
                                sisters Marian, Marinos, and Kohar, his sisters-in-law Shahvoroum and Marian, their sons Van, Zaram, Zakar, 
                                and Khutchadour, their daughters Yaghloukhan, Louroum, Parin, Heriknaz, Toukldzam, and Hurikhan, Van's 
                                wife Naner, her father Zarsam, and all the relatives that are near to his heart. May God give life and health to 
                                those who are living; and to those who are dead, peace and salvation, Amen. Again, I beseech you father and brothers 
                                that whenever you read this holy writ, remember in your fervent prayers the above-mentioned celibate, who bought this 
                                Holy Gospel with a thrice-desiring heart and gave it to you. His is a son of Zion and a household member of Jerusalem 
                                according to the Prophet. His self was absorbed because he did not have any immediate heir in the world besides his 
                                brothers and their families, and he did this with the best intentions. Now they live, but they are corruptible according to the 
                                law of nature, but his memorial remains forever. Amen. It is food in store and a guide for their souls on the way that leads 
                                to heaven. And I beseech you to remember also this humble scribe. Remember and you shall be remembered in our 
                                Lord, Amen. And also remember the celibate penitent Khouban and his uncle Mardiros who sleeps in Christ. May the 
                                Lord remember him and be merciful to him, and forgive his sins and give comfort to his children, Aris, Tamana, and Huazant.

                <p>The Edgar J. Goodspeed Manuscript Collection contains 68 Greek, Armenian, Latin, Syriac, Ethiopic, and 
                    Arabic manuscripts, which range in date from the fifth to the nineteenth century. With support from the Institute 
                    of Museum and Library Services National Leadership Grants for Libraries, Building Digital Resources program, 
                    the University of Chicago Library has created the online Goodspeed Manuscript Collection, a unique digital 
                    resource with manuscripts digitized in their entirety and presented with high-quality zoomable images through 
                    an interface that supports browsing within individual manuscripts and across the collection.</p>
                <p>Descriptions of the manuscripts have been encoded using the standard set forth in TEI Consortium, eds., <title>TEI P5 Guidelines for Electronic 
                    Text Encoding and Interchange: Manuscript Description</title>, at <ref>http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html</ref> 
                    as of <date>2012-09-22</date>.</p> 
                <p>The TEI DTD used was obtained from the Digital Scriptorium of Columbia University 
                    at, <ref>https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/cu/libraries/bts/digital_scriptorium/technical/ds-xml/description_dtd/index.html</ref> on <date>2012-09-22</date>. To 
                    accommodate specific project needs, the DTD was edited and extended with local tags in order to describe the content of miniatures, 
                    and the structure of canon tables, headpieces, and initials. The process of editing included equating the element Decoration with the seven 
                    recognized elements of the TEI Manuscript Description, not only to emphasize intellectual substance, but also to augment 
                    visibility by providing links from the record through encoding to the digitized imagery of the Web display.</p>

    <colophon>The deacon Yovannēs (dated 1670). Glory be to the Eternal Father and Son, and to the Holy Ghost, now and always 
  forever and ever. Amen. He gave strength to the humble deacon, who is called Yovannēs to complete the word of God, 
  the Gospel. I began with the grace of God and finished it with his mercies in the Armenian year of 1119. During the 
  patriarchate of his holiness Bedros the Catholicos, and in the time of Bishop Yovannēs of Alovans Shamkarou, which 
  belongs to St. Asdouadzadzin, a celibate penitent named Khouban desired and commissioned a Holy Gospel. It was to 
memorialize his own soul, the souls of his parents Sarkis and Tilikhan, those of his brothers Sahag and Abraham, his 
sisters Marian, Marinos, and Kohar, his sisters-in-law Shahvoroum and Marian, their sons Van, Zaram, Zakar, 
and Khutchadour, their daughters Yaghloukhan, Louroum, Parin, Heriknaz, Toukldzam, and Hurikhan, Van's 
wife Naner, her father Zarsam, and all the relatives that are near to his heart. May God give life and health to 
those who are living; and to those who are dead, peace and salvation, Amen. Again, I beseech you father and brothers 
that whenever you read this holy writ, remember in your fervent prayers the above-mentioned celibate, who bought this 
Holy Gospel with a thrice-desiring heart and gave it to you. His is a son of Zion and a household member of Jerusalem 
according to the Prophet. His self was absorbed because he did not have any immediate heir in the world besides his 
brothers and their families, and he did this with the best intentions. Now they live, but they are corruptible according to the 
law of nature, but his memorial remains forever. Amen. It is food in store and a guide for their souls on the way that leads 
to heaven. And I beseech you to remember also this humble scribe. Remember and you shall be remembered in our 
Lord, Amen. And also remember the celibate penitent Khouban and his uncle Mardiros who sleeps in Christ. May the 
Lord remember him and be merciful to him, and forgive his sins and give comfort to his children, Aris, Tamana, and Huazant.
