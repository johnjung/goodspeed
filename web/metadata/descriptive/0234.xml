  <projectDesc>
   <p>The Edgar J. Goodspeed Manuscript Collection contains 68 Greek, Armenian, Latin, Syriac, Ethiopic, and 
    Arabic manuscripts, which range in date from the fifth to the nineteenth century. With support from the Institute 
    of Museum and Library Services National Leadership Grants for Libraries, Building Digital Resources program, 
    the University of Chicago Library has created the online Goodspeed Manuscript Collection, a unique digital 
    resource with manuscripts digitized in their entirety and presented with high-quality zoomable images through 
    an interface that supports browsing within individual manuscripts and across the collection.</p>
   <p>Descriptions of the manuscripts have been encoded using the standard set forth in TEI Consortium, eds., <title>TEI P5 Guidelines for Electronic 
    Text Encoding and Interchange: Manuscript Description</title>, at <ref>http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html</ref> 
    as of <date>2012-09-22</date>.</p> 
   <p>The TEI DTD used was obtained from the Digital Scriptorium of Columbia University 
    at, <ref>https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/cu/libraries/bts/digital_scriptorium/technical/ds-xml/description_dtd/index.html</ref> on <date>2012-09-22</date>. To 
    accommodate specific project needs, the DTD was edited and extended with local tags in order to describe the content of miniatures, 
    and the structure of canon tables, headpieces, and initials. The process of editing included equating the element Decoration with the seven 
    recognized elements of the TEI Manuscript Description, not only to emphasize intellectual substance, but also to augment 
    visibility by providing links from the record through encoding to the digitized imagery of the Web display.</p>
