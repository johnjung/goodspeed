                <p>The Edgar J. Goodspeed Manuscript Collection contains 68 Greek, Armenian, Latin,
                    Syriac, Ethiopic, and Arabic manuscripts, which range in date from the fifth to
                    the nineteenth century. With support from the Institute of Museum and Library
                    Services National Leadership Grants for Libraries, Building Digital Resources
                    program, the University of Chicago Library has created the online Goodspeed
                    Manuscript Collection, a unique digital resource with manuscripts digitized in
                    their entirety and presented with high-quality zoomable images through an
                    interface that supports browsing within individual manuscripts and across the
                    collection.</p>
                <p>Descriptions of the manuscripts have been encoded using the standard set forth in
                    TEI Consortium, eds., <title>TEI P5 Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
                        Interchange: Manuscript Description</title>, at <ref>http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html</ref> as of
                    <date>2012-09-22</date>.</p>
                <p>The TEI DTD used was obtained from the Digital Scriptorium of Columbia University
                    at, <ref>https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/cu/libraries/bts/digital_scriptorium/technical/ds-xml/description_dtd/index.html</ref>
                    on <date>2012-09-22</date>. To accommodate specific project needs, the DTD was
                    edited and extended with local tags in order to describe the content of
                    miniatures, and the structure of canon tables, headpieces, and initials. The
                    process of editing included equating the element Decoration with the seven
                    recognized elements of the TEI Manuscript Description, not only to emphasize
                    intellectual substance, but also to augment visibility by providing links from
                    the record through encoding to the digitized imagery of the Web display.</p>
