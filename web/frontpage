<p>The Goodspeed Collection of New Testament Manuscripts comprises 65 early
Greek, Syriac, Ethiopic, Armenian, Arabic, and Latin manuscripts ranging in
date from the 7th to the 19th centuries.  The acquisition of these hitherto
unknown manuscripts was spearheaded by Edgar J. Goodspeed in the first half of
the twentieth century in order to support new scholarship in the
humanities.</p>

<p>With support from the <a href="http://www.imls.gov">Institute of Museum and
Library Services</a> National Leadership Grants for Libraries
- Building Digital Resources program, the University of Chicago Library is
  creating a unique digital resource based on this collection.  All 65 New
Testament manuscripts and an additional 114 papyri fragments will be digitized
in their entirety and presented with high-quality zoomable images through an
interface that supports browsing within individual manuscripts and across the
collection. The Goodspeed Manuscript Collection Project continues the scholarly
tradition of the Goodspeed Collection itself and will support new types of
research and teaching made possible by digital technologies.</p>
